# internet-speed-notifier
This app notifes the internet speed through voice and windows notification every n minutes. By default n=300 sec.

Sometimes in few cases where network speed fluctuates, it becomes necessary to get notified about the network speed with an interval of time.

Presently, I am staying in a developing country where broadband speed fluctuates a lot. The broadband connection is of 10 MBPS but sometimes it becomes 0.5 MBPS. So, it is important for me to get notifed when the network speed becomes more than 5 MBPS, so that I can work without trouble. Thus is the reason to build this app.

### Future Updates
* Send email when the speed is more than defined speed.
* Play a defined audio when the speed is more than defined speed.
