# Internet Speed Notifier
This app notifies the internet speed through voice and windows notification every n second. By default n=300.

Sometimes in a few cases where network speed fluctuates, it becomes necessary to get notified about the network speed with an interval of time.

Presently, I am staying in a developing country where broadband speed fluctuates a lot. The broadband connection is of 10 MBPS but sometimes it becomes 0.5 MBPS. So, it is important for me to get notified when the network speed becomes more than 5 MBPS so that I can work without trouble. This is the reason to build this app.

### Future Updates
* Send email when the speed is more than defined speed.
* Play defined audio when the speed is more than defined speed.
* Change the network if the present network is slow, automatically revert to primary network e.g. broadband, when the expected speed is met.
